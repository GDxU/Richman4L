# Introduction

Those libraries are got from some websites like GitHub, They are here just because I can't find them from Nuget, So I cloned those code and edit them to use them in Richman4L.

## FIGlet.Net

FIGlet.Net is an Ascii-Art generator.

I got it from here : https://github.com/auriou/FIGlet

I have rewrite this library completely, I think I can even republish this library, But I think I should learn more about FIGlet.

## FoggyConsole

FoggyConsole can draw UI in console.

I got it from here : https://github.com/luto/FoggyConsole

I also edit this library in many ways. I'll republish this library in a other repo.
