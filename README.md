# Richman4L

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/drlqwko7xlhsct6u?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/WenceyWang/richman4l)

Richman4L is a game which is like Richman4Fun.

This game is a free software published under AGPL.

I started this project just because a girl wanted to play this, but now I just want to finish this project.

I use TFS, and this repo is only a mirror.

There are some documentations on the Wiki Page.

I have spent 100+ week on this project, and I will try my best to finish this project.

If you want to help me finish this project, just leave me an e-mail: wencey@outlook.com
